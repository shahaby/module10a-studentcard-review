# Module 10A – StudentCard Code Review

## Description

This is a React code review assignment. I reviewed the StudentCard component and added comments to
explain the logic behind props, state, and interactivity. I noticed there was an error in the code
and, upon further investigation, realized the React library was not imported inside the component JSX
file.

## What I Learned

- How to use and identify props and state
- How toggle functionality works with useState
- How to better document and explain React components
